# Smart Schedule Tool - Node Express Version

This is a simple full-stack web application built with Node.js and Express. It features a beautiful, responsive frontend using EJS templates, Bootstrap, and custom CSS. The app demonstrates a basic structure for course scheduling and management.

## What to Expect

- **Homepage:**  
  A vibrant hero section with a gradient background, animated text, and multiple navigation buttons.
- **Navigation:**  
  Buttons that lead to placeholder pages (such as viewing, adding, and editing courses) as well as feature details.
- **REST API:**  
  A simple API endpoint at `/api/courses` that returns sample course data in JSON format.
- **Design:**  
  Modern design elements with animations, feature cards, and a testimonials section.

## What It Cannot Do Yet

- **Persistent Data:**  
  All course data is currently hard-coded. There is no database integration.
- **User Management:**  
  There is no user authentication or account management.
- **Advanced Functionality:**  
  The placeholder pages do not yet perform real CRUD operations.
